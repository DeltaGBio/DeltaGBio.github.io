I'm a pharmacist turned structural biologist and protein designer.

I'm passionate about protein structures and dynamics with a strong foundation of physical chemistry and integrative structural biology.

My focus is on integrating deep learning with physics-based simulations and experimental data to understand and design proteins with novel functions.
